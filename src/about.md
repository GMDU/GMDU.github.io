# About <span class="font-heading">GMDU</span>

<span class="font-heading">GMDU</span>, or Gears (and) Moxvallix Datapack Universe, is a small team of datapack developers making needlessly complicated datapacks for Minecraft: Java Edition.
The <span class="font-heading">GMDU</span> team, unsurprisingly, consists of Gears, and Moxvallix.

Our main focus has been [Code of Copper](/projects/code_of_copper/), but we are looking to work on some other projects
as well. All of our projects can be found on our [Projects Page](/projects/).
