# About GMDU

GMDU, or Gears (and) Moxvallix Datapack Universe, is a small team of datapack developers making
needlessly complicated datapacks for Minecraft: Java Edition. The GMDU team, unsurprisingly, consists
of Gears, and Moxvallix.

Our main focus has been [Code of Copper](/projects/code_of_copper/), but we are looking to work on some other projects
as well. All of our projects can be found on our [Projects Page](/projects/).
