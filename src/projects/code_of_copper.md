# {{ title }}
**{{ subtitle }}**

{{ title }} was made for the 7th [Datapack Jam](https://www.planetminecraft.com/group/datapack_jam).

Within the span of a week, we managed to implement a full text-based programming language in a vanilla datapack.
This was made possible thanks to [Snapshot 23w03a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-23w03a),
which enabled us to split strings into arrays of characters.

{{ title }} shows us how such a small, simple change, such as string splitting, can enable us to do so much more with datapacks.
It won first place in the jam, and has been actively developed ever since.
