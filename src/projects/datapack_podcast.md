With episodes releasing every two weeks, the Datapack Podcast aims to provide the niche datapacking
community with something to listen to whilst they wrangle NBT (or whatever else datapackers do).

GMDU, in the Datapack Podcast, will discuss updates to the game, interview members of the community, or just talk about Minecraft, all through the lens of datapack development.
