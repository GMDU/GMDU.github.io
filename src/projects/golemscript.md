# {{ title }}
**{{ subtitle }}**

{{title}} is a high-level, interpreted, functional programming language, with Ruby/JS inspired syntax.

It implements many helpful types, such as objects, arrays, and even Minecraft specific types like the resource type.

It originated as a part of [Code of Copper](/projects/code_of_copper), but was separated from it for ease of maintenance, and extensibility.

This library allows any datapack to implement the {{title}} language, and provide any interface or functions for it they desire.
