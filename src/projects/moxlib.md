# {{ title }}
**Moxvallix's Datapack Creation Library**

{{ title }} aims to make Datapack creation fun and enjoyable.

With a predictable API, and a focus on data driven functionality, {{ title }} serves
as an excellent foundation to any Datapack project.

{{ title }} aims to run as little as possible on the tick function. Most functions
in the pack only run when they are called.

Another focus of the pack is instantaneous functions. Most of the functions
in the pack have been designed to run in a single tick, and do not use schedules,
or other timer based methods.
