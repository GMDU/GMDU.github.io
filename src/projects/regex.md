# {{ title }}
**{{ subtitle }}**

The concept for {{ title }} was made after the announcement of [Snapshot 23w03a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-23w03a).

Gears and Moxvallix had been in a Discord call, a few days after the release of the snapshot, and speculated that a
Regex matcher should now be possible.

After releasing v1 of Code of Copper, the two set to work trying to make the library, for it to be used in Code of Copper.

Since, it hasn't seen much development activity, but bugfixes are planned in the future.
